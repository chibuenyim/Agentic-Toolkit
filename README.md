## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Show usage
agentic-toolkit

# Generate tasks from plan.md
agentic-toolkit plan

# Show example plan template
agentic-toolkit example
```

### Provider Switching

```bash
# Switch to OpenRouter
./scripts/switch-openrouter.sh

# Switch to Ollama
./scripts/switch-ollama.sh
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Use the convenience script
./scripts/plan.sh
```

## Configuration

The toolkit supports multiple AI providers:
